          <p>I got more interested in learning and following my curiosities
          after I took a break from college back in 2009.  That was when I
          really started to go into stuff that was important to me, and
          programming was one of those things.  I really like the idea of
          creating my own programs. </p>

          <p>I talked to a few different people about the legitimacy of dev boot
          camps before I joined one.  You can learn a language anywhere.  You
          can go to Codecademy or wherever.  But the real value here is your
          time with senior developers.</p>

          <p>I would really like to get into some freelance work.  It takes
          discipline but if you can get a good feel for what you need to do,
          it’s really rewarding to deal directly with clients and be your own boss.</p>

          <p>If I ever give people answers, I rob them of that ability to kind of
          have that ‘ah-ha’ moment. But if I can sort of step back enough and
          create the right environment and people can come to these conclusions
          without me telling them what it is, I really feel like there is a
          physiological response I have to that which is excitement and it’s
          addicting - in a positive way.</p>

          <p>When looking for a new hire, the number one thing is - you just have to
          have “it” and sadly, I probably rely too much on intuition.  What I’m
          looking for is curiosity.  People talk about passion.  I’m not sure I
          need passion. I mean thats a pretty strong word in your life.  You
          should be passionate about the people in your life not necessarily tech.</p>

          <p>I’ve heard this somewhere else, but I find it to be entirely true.
          For a strong team dynamic, you want a good mix of speed, weight, and
          hunger.  So you want a good mix of people who know what they’re doing,
          but maybe they’ve been there and done that. You want people who are just
          really really freakin’ smart.  Just raw processing speed.  When new
          information comes in they can just digest it.  And then people who just
          want it really badly.  And it’s not always that they are three different
          people, but you want to have a good mix on that on your team.</p>
