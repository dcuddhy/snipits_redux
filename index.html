        <p>If I ever give people answers, I rob them of that ability to kind of
        have that ‘ah-ha’ moment. But if I can sort of step back enough and
        create the right environment and people can come to these conclusions
        without me telling them what it is, I really feel like there is a
        physiological response I have to that which is excitement and it’s
        addicting - in a positive way.</p>

        <p>When looking for a new hire, the number one thing is - you just have to
        have “it” and sadly, I probably rely too much on intuition.  What I’m
        looking for is curiosity.  People talk about passion.  I’m not sure I
        need passion. I mean thats a pretty strong word in your life.  You
        should be passionate about the people in your life not necessarily tech.</p>

        <p>I’ve heard this somewhere else, but I find it to be entirely true.
        For a strong team dynamic, you want a good mix of speed, weight, and
        hunger.  So you want a good mix of people who know what they’re doing,
        but maybe they’ve been there and done that. You want people who are just
        really really freakin’ smart.  Just raw processing speed.  When new
        information comes in they can just digest it.  And then people who just
        want it really badly.  And it’s not always that they are three different
        people, but you want to have a good mix on that on your team.</p>
